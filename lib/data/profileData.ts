  bio: "",
  bioFull: `I am a highly motivated Computer Engineering graduate with one year of technical support and application development experience, working as an Application Lead under the Supply Chain Execution (SCE) team. In this role, I gained hands-on experience across the full application lifecycle from developing new features and managing data requests to providing essential user support and ensuring the smooth, reliable operation of critical business applications.
            My professional background has given me a strong understanding of real-world system issues and user-centric solutions. This operational insight now fuels my passion for software and web development. I genuinely enjoy learning new technologies and building small projects to enhance my skills, positioning myself to become a “developer who understands the user.”
        I am eager to secure a role where I can combine my operational expertise, system troubleshooting skills, and growing development capabilities to deliver high-quality, robust software solutions.`,
  beyondCoding: "I join online communities and forums to stay updated with the latest trends and best practices in software development. I also participate in coding challenges to sharpen my skills and collaborate with other developers. Additionally, I enjoy mentoring junior developers and contributing to open-source projects whenever possible.",
